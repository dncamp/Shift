This repository contains the code for the exploratory data analysis of effect of the infield shift in Major League Baseball. In this analysis, I look at statistics like batting average on balls in play, weighted on base average, and launch angle to evaluate how offenses are affected by the infield shift. Using the data visualization tools in R, I illustrate this exploration and arrive at a conclusion regarding the effect of the infield shift and what would happen were it to be banned.
