James Ding 2021-01-20 Chapter 1 Introduction As critics of Major League Baseball bemoan its slow pace of play and lack of action, one particular strategy has come under heavy scrutiny: the infield shift. While rarely utilized just a decade ago, in the 2020 MLB season teams utilized the shift in 34.1% of all plate appearances, according to Statcast. Advocates for the shift will point to the added strategy that the shift brings, and will point out that hitters should just learn to hit to the opposite field or bunt to counter the shift. On the other hand, critics will point out that the league is currently experiencing a historically low batting average due to the shift. Many media members have even advocated for banning the infield shift. However, to fully understand the effect of banning the shift, we need to understand what effect the shift has on the game of baseball. 1.1 What is the shift? Before we dive into the data and analytics, we need to formally define the infield shift. In a standard defensive alignment, the first baseman and the second baseman are positioned between first and second base, while the shortstop and third baseman are positioned between second and third base. Colloquially, when people mention the shift, they are referring to the defensive alignment where three infielders are on one side of second base. While there are technically many other types of shifts, such as moving the first and third basemen closer to the foul lines to guard the lines, these shifts have not received nearly as much controversy as the alignment where three infielders are on one side of second base. Furthermore, most of the proposed rules to prevent shifting focus on restricting defenses to two infielders on each side of second base. As such, these shifts will not receive much discussion in this exploration. "],["balls-in-play.html", "Chapter 2 Balls In Play", " Chapter 2 Balls In Play The main idea behind the shift is to get outs on ground balls and line drives that would normally be hits with a standard defensive alignment. Therefore, when evaluating the shift, we may want to focus on balls put into play. On the surface, it seems that the shift has no effect in preventing hits. (Note: Strategic is a catch-all term that Statcast uses for all non-standard defensive alignments that do not have three infielders on one side of second base). However, the infield shift is only effective at stopping hits from ground balls and line drives. If we restrict our sample to those two, we get the following graph: The proportion still remains the same, even when only looking at ground balls and line drives. Is it possible that the shift really has no effect? Most likely not, as this sample is taken over all batters. Teams will most likely only shift against batters who are known to hit to one side of the field. For example, take a look at ground balls hit by Anthony Rizzo in 2020: Since Rizzo rarely hits ground balls to the left side of the field, it makes no sense to position multiple fielders on the left side of second base. Therefore, if teams were to use a standard defensive alignment against Rizzo, it is probable that he would get more hits than if Rizzo were facing the shift. In that sense, the infield shift may be effective against specific batters, which is why it is only utilized 34% of the time. Therefore, we need to focus on these batters to get a sense of the effectiveness of the shift. Interestingly, it seems that in general a players BABIP (batting average on balls in play) is against the shift is unrelated to his BABIP against other defensive alignments. The chart above used players who put at least 10 balls in play against each alignment. Even when we limit it to players who put at least 50 ball into play against the shift, we see a similar result: Since these players are the ones who face the shift often, these are the players that defenses must be targeting with the shift. However, it seems that BABIP is not the main reason defenses are employing the shift, given the above graphs. Perhaps there is another metric that teams are using to evaluate the shift. "],["woba.html", "Chapter 3 wOBA 3.1 What is wOBA? 3.2 xWOBA", " Chapter 3 wOBA While batting average used to be considered one of the most important statistics in baseball, nowadays front office staff have realized its flaws. General Managers now like to use more advanced analytics to determine a players offensive capabilities. Perhaps one of these metrics can be used to show the value of the shift. 3.1 What is wOBA? Weighted On-Base Average (wOBA) is a statistic that aims to correct some of the flaws of batting average and on-base percentage by assigning a different value for different results. For example, since hitting a home run is better than hitting a single, a home run is weighted more than a single when calculating wOBA. For more information about the statistic, visit this fangraphs site detailing the calculation and usage of wOBA: https://library.fangraphs.com/offense/woba/ wOBA is used as part of many different advanced analytics in baseball, such as wRC+ and WAR, so teams may be using wOBA to determine the effectiveness of the infield shift. The above graph uses data of players who faced the shift at least 100 times in 2020, so it is surprising that teams chose to utilize the shift against these players even though there is no clear relationship. However, using even more advanced analytics, we can take a deeper dive into the wOBA 3.2 xWOBA Expected wOBA (xwOBA) is a metric created by MLBs Statcast that uses predicted outcomes of balls put into play rather than actual results. Imagine if the batter hits a scorching line drive into the gap, but the defender makes a great diving catch to rob the batter of the hit. While wOBA would credit the batter with an out, xwOBA would recognize that the play results in a hit the majority of the time. This makes xwOBA excellent in predicting future player performance, especially with a small sample size. For more information about xwOBA, check out this blog post from MLBs technology team: https://technology.mlblogs.com/an-introduction-to-expected-weighted-on-base-average-xwoba-29d6070ba52b The three variables used by Statcast to predict batted ball results are exit velocity, launch angle, and sprint speed. Notably, the model does not take into account defensive alignments, leading to many incorrect predictions for balls hit against the infield shift. Using xwOBA as a proxy for how the players would perform against standard defensive alignments, we can see if the shift has a significant effect on the players actual performance. The line on the graph marks where wOBA equals xwOBA, so it seems that even against the shift batters generally performed as expected, even though the model used for predictions does not take into account defensive alignment. It seems that batters who face the shift often would perform similarly against a standard defensive alignment. Most likely, batters have adjusted their approach to hitting due to the prevalence of the shift. "],["three-true-outcomes.html", "Chapter 4 Three True Outcomes 4.1 Launch Angle 4.2 Three True Outcomes", " Chapter 4 Three True Outcomes One of the complaints about the shift is that it encourages hitters to hit for power rather than contact. Since hitting a hard ground ball into the shift will likely result in an out, hitters instead try to hit it over the shift, thereby making the shift ineffective. 4.1 Launch Angle When evaluating if the hitters are trying to hit over the shift, we should first start by taking a look at launch angle(the trajectory of ball after the batter makes contact). The shift excels at fielding ground balls and low line drives, which are the result of low launch angles. By increasing the launch angle, batters can try to hit more fly balls and higher line drives to avoid the shift. It does seem like there is a weak correlation between a batters average launch angle and how often they hit against the shift. This supports the idea that batters are trying to hit the ball over the shift. Furthermore, the correlation between the two variables is 0.3894903. Understandably, there is also a correlation between a players average launch angle and the percentage of their batted balls that are fly balls. 4.2 Three True Outcomes With the increase in launch angle comes an increase in fly balls. However, fly balls are usually ineffective at getting hits, with one huge exception: the home run. Some fans have criticized modern baseball for lacking action, as many plate appearances now end in either a walk, a strikeout, or a home run. These three events are referred to as the three true outcomes because they dont involve the defense, and therefore dont create any action. Critics of the infield shift feel that it encourages a three true outcome approach to hitting, since the hitters will try to hit home runs to counter the shift. It seems that batters hit more home runs, draw more walks, and strike out more against the infield shift than against a standard defensive alignment. This can be attributed to the home run or bust mentality: Since fly balls are usually outs if they are not home runs, then its better to wait for a pitch that can be driven out of the park. If the pitch doesnt come, just take the walk or the strikeout. This mentality is clear in the graph below. While the league in general is trending towards more plate appearances resulting in one of the three true outcomes, the shift clearly results in more three true outcome plate appearances by about four to six percentage points, depending on the year. This divide suggests that batters who face the shift have a different hitting approach than those who do not face the shift often. It seems that the prevalence of the infield shift has caused teams to make changes to their offense. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 5 Conclusion", " Chapter 5 Conclusion When looking at offensive performance against the infield shift and standard infield alignments, many statistics appear to show that the shift has very little, if any, effect on the overall performance of the hitter. The reason this happens is that hitters who face the infield shift often tend to have higher average launch angles, which bypasses the shift entirely by hitting the ball in the air. Consequently, this has led to an increase in strikeouts, walks, and home runs against the shift. This emphasis on the three true outcomes could be the result of two scenarios: Hitters that face the shift often adjusted their swing for larger launch angles, or The hitters that were unable to make the adjustment performed poorly against the shift and were replaced Given the information presented here, what will happen if MLB bans the infield shift? Likely, there would be little effect on the league. Since the hitters who face the shift often tend to be hitters with high launch angles, banning the shift wont have a major effect on their performance. Furthermore, the league has been trending towards three true outcome hitters for some time, and the trend will likely continue. The infield shift simply accelerated this trend, and banning it will likely not change this trajectory. "]]
